## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While I was working on this project I was able to learn more about the responsiveness using de different display types. I also put to work my understanding of the transitions in CSS.
And overall, I learned more about the implementation of SASS.

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing more my skills to create responsive designs with CSS. And start implementing some Javascript to my applications.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This helped me to understand the implementation of Sass in my project.
- [Mozila Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to do my research to be able to apply some specific styles.
